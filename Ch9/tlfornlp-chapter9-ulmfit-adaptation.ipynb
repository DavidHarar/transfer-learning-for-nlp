While not mentioning U.S. President Donald Trump by name, Manning wrote in Britain’s the Guardian that “after eight years of attempted compromise and relentless disrespect in return, we are moving into darker times” and urged Democrats not to compromise.  Trump responded in a tweet, calling her a traitor and criticizing the decision to release her.  “Ungrateful TRAITOR Chelsea Manning, who should never have been released from prison, is now calling President Obama a weak leader. Terrible!” Trump wrote.      Manning had been sentenced to 35 years in prison after   committing the biggest breach of classified information in American history in 2010 by handing over U.S. government secrets to anti-secrecy group Wikileaks.   In one of his final actions before leaving office last week, Obama commuted Manning’s sentence to about seven years, allowing it to end on May 17. Republicans, including Trump’s spokesman, criticized the commutation as a dangerous precedent for leakers. Obama has defended the move, saying Manning had served a tough sentence and that justice had been served. He also said it was unrelated to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange’s pledge to accept extradition to the United States, where there is an open criminal investigation into the group’s activities, if Manning was freed. Wikileaks, in its own tweet on Thursday, rejected Trump’s assertion as “wrong,” noting that Manning was found not guilty of the most serious charge, aiding the enemy.  Manning, formerly known as U.S. Army Private First Class Bradley Manning, was born male but revealed after being convicted of espionage that she identifies as a woman. She has struggled to cope as a transgender woman in a men’s military prison and last year twice tried to kill herself. In her Guardian piece, she did not directly acknowledge Obama’s commutation. Instead, Manning said the former president compromised too much and left a “vulnerable legacy” with “very few permanent accomplishments.”  She raised concerns about worsening healthcare, increased criminalization of racial minorities and “queer and trans people,” and she urged political progressives to prepare to dig in and push for “change at every level.”  “The one simple lesson to draw from President Obama’s legacy: Do not start off with a compromise. They won’t meet you in the middle. Instead, what we need is an unapologetic progressive leader.”  '\n  'politicsNews' 'January 26, 2017 ']\n ['Magnitude 6.4 aftershock hits off New Caledonia: USGS'\n  '(Reuters) - An aftershock of magnitude 6.4 struck off the French Pacific territory of New Caledonia on Wednesday, a day after the archipelago was shaken by a magnitude 6.8 quake, the U.S. Geological Survey said.

Twenty-seven percent of voters were undecided, according data from a Research Affairs online poll of 600 people released late Saturday by tabloid newspaper Oesterreich. Another poll published on Sunday by the Kurier newspaper showed 33 percent of voters backed Kurz s conservative party, with current Chancellor Christian Kern s left-leaning Social Democrats running second at 27 percent.  The rightist Freedom Party was third, according to the Kurier poll, with 25 percent.     Last week the Social Democrats  chairman resigned after the party was linked to two Facebook accounts that made unsubstantiated allegations against Kurz and the controversy is likely boost voter turnout, said Wolfgang Bachmayer, whose OGM research service conducted the survey for Kurier.  His poll suggests 79 percent of eligible voters will cast their ballots.     Issues of substance have been completely overshadowed, with mud-slinging instead moving into the spotlight,  Bachmayer said .  On the brighter side of things, there are clear indications that participation will rise.  Austria s co-governing Social Democrats and conservative People s Party  said on Friday they would sue each other in the escalating scandal. The Kurier poll was conducted between Sept. 29 and Oct. 5 and included 1,002 telephone interviews, with 470 people identifying themselves as voters  certain  to cast ballots on Oct. 15. Oesterreich s online survey, gathered from last Monday to Wednesday, had a relatively small sample size of 600 people, with a wide margin of error.

South Korea and Japan are accustomed to the North’s frequent threats to attack. But the war of words between Washington and Pyongyang has raised fears of a sudden clash along the world’s most militarised border dividing the two Koreas, which might quickly escalate to all-out war. After North Korea’s second test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on July 28, South Korean President Moon Jae-in ordered a speedy deployment of the controversial U.S. THAAD anti-missile defense system, reversing his earlier decision to postpone it pending an environmental review.  This week, the U.S. Defence Department said it was “actively” considering revising bilateral ballistic missile guidelines with South Korea to allow Seoul to build more powerful missiles — at the South’s request. Moon told U.S. President Donald Trump in a telephone conversation on Monday South Korea also wants to build a nuclear-powered submarine, presidential officials said. “All of this could lead to further militarization of South Korea,” said Yang Uk, a senior research fellow at the Korea Defence and Security Forum. South Korea, which spends around a tenth of its annual budget on defense, is already home to some 625,000 local soldiers and more than 28,000 U.S. troops. The country, still technically at war with the North after the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce and not a peace treaty, has deployed the U.S.-built Patriot missile defense system, as well as the Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) system. Trump warned the North and its leader Kim Jong Un against attacking Guam or U.S. allies on Friday, a day after the isolated country said it was finalizing by mid-August a plan to launch four intermediate range missiles toward waters off the U.S. Pacific territory. “If North Korea actually launches Hwasong-12 missiles towards Guam, they’re going to do it with all their other missiles, artillery and tanks ready for action,” said Kim Dong-yub, a military expert at Kyungnam University’s Institute of Far Eastern Studies in Seoul. “And we should be prepared too.” Even before the latest spike in tensions, South Korea was seeking to enhance its missile-defense capabilities in the face of the unprecedented pace of North Korean missile tests. Japan, worried its ballistic missile defenses could be overwhelmed by swarm attacks or circumvented by warheads launched on lofted trajectories, is likely to acquire a ground-based version of the Aegis missile defense system. It is also mulling the acquisition of munitions that would allow it to strike North Korea missile sites. “The greatest threat to both states remains shorter range artillery, artillery rockets and stockpiles of short-to-medium range missiles. The focus will primarily remain\\xa0upon bolstering defensive\\xa0rather than offensive capabilities,” said Reed Foster, a defense analyst for IHS Jane’s. “I don’t believe that there will be any significant altering of East Asian\\xa0procurement strategies, despite the rhetoric emanating from North Korea, principally because for them the threat hasn’t altered drastically,” Reed added. Conservative lawmakers in Seoul in recent days have even called for a “nuclear balance” on the peninsula, saying Seoul should ask Washington to redeploy U.S. nuclear weapons if South Korea is unable to develop its own. The United States withdrew nuclear weapons from South Korea in 1992, when the two Koreas agreed to make the peninsula nuclear free. In violation of that agreement as well as U.N. Security Council resolutions, North Korea has conducted five nuclear tests. “Now is the right time to actively look at bringing back tactical nuclear weapons,” Chung Woo-taik, floor leader of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party, told Reuters. “North Korea broke the denuclearisation agreement a long time ago.” Reintroducing nuclear weapons remains an unlikely scenario, as that would undermine demands from Seoul and Washington for North Korea to abandon its nuclear programs. For now, officials are instead focused on changing the missile guidelines, which allow Seoul to have ballistic missiles with a flight range capped at 800 km (497 miles), topped with a maximum 500 kg (1,102 pounds) warhead. South Korea is less focused on increasing the flight range, as that could face opposition from neighbors including China, Russia and Japan, and the 800-km range limit covers all of North Korea in any case, senior government officials said. Rather, Seoul wants to double the maximum payload to 1,000 kg or greater, powerful enough to target underground bunkers or nuclear sites within the North, the officials said. That’s still a fraction of the size of “the mother of all bombs”, which the United States dropped on a suspected Islamic State target in Afghanistan in April. The 21,600-pound GBU-43 bomb is one of the largest non-nuclear devices used in combat.

House members voted 246-181 to pass the “Iran Terror Finance Transparency Act,” almost entirely along party lines, with almost every “yes” vote coming from Republicans and Democrats overwhelmingly opposed to it.  The legislation is not expected to become law, even though Republicans control both the House and Senate. Even if it were passed by the Senate, Obama has promised a veto, saying the measure would kill the landmark nuclear agreement. The House narrowly passed the legislation last month, but the vote was voided after nearly a third of the chamber showed up too late to cast their votes. The voided vote took place on Jan. 13. On Jan. 16, U.S. and Iranian authorities announced a complex deal in which Iran released four American prisoners just as the international nuclear agreement was implemented. Congressional aides said the House vote was voided because the new House speaker, Paul Ryan, was pushing members to arrive for votes on time, not because of any connection to the prisoner deal. Democratic lawmakers noted that the repeated vote was not the only one in the House on Tuesday that evoked references to “Groundhog Day,” the 1993 film in which the character played by the actor Bill Murray lives the same day over and over again. The Iran bill was passed just after House Republicans tried and failed to override Obama’s veto of legislation to repeal his healthcare law. House Republicans have voted more than 60 times to try to repeal the healthcare overhaul, one of the Democratic president’s signature domestic policy achievements.

in - law launches xxmaj middle xxmaj east peace effort \" \n  ' xxup jerusalem ( xxmaj reuters ) - xxup u.s. xxmaj president xxmaj donald xxmaj trump ’s son - in - law and senior adviser , xxmaj jared xxmaj kushner , met xxmaj israeli and xxmaj palestinian leaders on xxmaj wednesday to try to revive long - fractured xxmaj middle xxmaj east peacemaking that xxmaj washington acknowledged will take some time . xxmaj kushner , a 36-year - old real estate developer with little experience of international diplomacy or political negotiation , arrived in xxmaj israel on xxmaj wednesday morning and was due to spend barely 20 hours on the ground . xxmaj video showed him giving xxmaj israeli xxmaj prime xxmaj minister xxmaj benjamin xxmaj netanyahu , a friend of xxmaj kushner ’s father , a xxunk and a xxunk as they prepared to sit down with the xxmaj israeli ambassador to xxmaj washington , the xxup u.s. ambassador to xxmaj israel and other senior officials for preliminary discussions . “ xxmaj this is an opportunity to pursue our common goals of security , prosperity and peace , ” xxmaj netanyahu said . “ xxmaj jared , i welcome you here in that spirit . i know of your efforts , the president ’s efforts , and i look forward to working with you to achieve these common goals . ” xxmaj kushner replied : “ xxmaj the president sends his best regards and it ’s an honor to be here with you . ” xxmaj kushner did not speak to the media or take questions , maintaining the xxunk profile he has established since xxmaj trump took office in xxmaj january . xxup u.s. officials and xxmaj israeli leaders “ underscored that forging peace will take time and stressed the importance of doing everything possible to create an environment xxunk to peacemaking , ” the xxmaj white xxmaj house later said in a statement . xxmaj kushner traveled to xxmaj ramallah , in the xxmaj israeli - occupied xxmaj west xxmaj bank , for two hours of talks with xxmaj palestinian xxmaj president xxmaj mahmoud xxmaj abbas after xxunk , the evening meal that breaks the daily xxmaj ramadan fast . xxmaj abbas spokesman xxmaj nabil xxmaj abu xxmaj xxunk said all major issues at the heart of the conflict were discussed . xxup u.s. officials called the trip part of an effort to keep the conversation going rather than the launching of a new phase in the peace process , saying that xxmaj kushner and xxmaj jason xxmaj greenblatt , the president ’s special representative for international negotiations , are likely to return often . xxmaj trump has described peace between the xxmaj israelis and the xxmaj palestinians as “ the ultimate deal ” and made it a priority . xxmaj as well as receiving both xxmaj netanyahu and xxmaj abbas in the xxmaj white xxmaj house , he visited the region last month . xxmaj but it remains unclear what approach xxmaj trump , via xxmaj kushner and xxmaj greenblatt , plans to take on resolving one of the world ’s most xxunk conflicts . xxmaj for at least two decades , the goal of u.s.-led diplomacy has been a “ two - state solution ” , meaning an independent xxmaj palestinian state living side - by - side and at peace with xxmaj israel . xxmaj but when xxmaj trump met xxmaj netanyahu in xxmaj washington in xxmaj february , he said he was not fixed on two states saying , “ i ’m looking at two -
