# transfer-learning-for-nlp
Companion repository to Paul Azunre's "Transfer Learning for Natural Language Processing" Book

Rendered Jupyter notebooks are organized in folders by Chapter, with each folder containing a corresponding `requirements.txt` file representing Kaggle docker image dependencies at the time of their latest succesful run by the author.

Ideally, run these directly on Kaggle, where their mirrors are hosted. This will require little to no setup on your part.

Alternatively, consider installing Anaconda locally and running the notebooks that way.

Should you decide to convert them to `.py` files for running them locally, you will likely deal with a lot installation debugging, etc. While this is a great learning experience everyone should try at least once in their career, do so at your own risk :-)

The following is an evolving list of notebooks that have been hosted so far, their corresponding Chapters and Kaggle links. This list will naturally grow longer as more chapters of this MEAP release are completed.

Just hit `Copy and Edit Kernel` at the top right of each Kaggle kernel page (after creating an account) to get going right away. Note that for GPU enabled notebooks, your **FREE** Kaggle GPU time is limited (to 30 hours/week in February 2020, with the clock resetting at the end of each Friday). Be cautious and shut such notebooks down when not needed, when debugging non-GPU critical parts of the code, etc.
