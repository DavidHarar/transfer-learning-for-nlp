      "[['Australia, citing concerns over China, cracks down on foreign political influence'\n",
      "  'SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia, concerned about rising Chinese influence, will ban foreign political donations as part of a crackdown aimed at preventing external interference in domestic politics, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said on Tuesday. Turnbull told reporters in Canberra that foreign powers were making  unprecedented and increasingly sophisticated attempts to influence the political process  in Australia and the world. He cited  disturbing reports about Chinese influence . Australia and neighbouring New Zealand are among roughly a third of countries worldwide that allow foreign donations to political parties. Such donations are prohibited in the United States, Britain and several European countries. Australia s new laws, modelled in part on the U.S. Foreign Agents Registration Act, would criminalise foreign interference and require the registration of lobbyists working for nation states, Turnbull said. The announcement came as concern grows that Beijing may be extending its influence and as relationships between Australian politicians and Chinese government interests have become increasingly contentious. Fairfax Media and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported in June on a concerted campaign by China to  infiltrate  Australian politics to promote Chinese interests. China denies the claims.  In Beijing, foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China had no intention of interfering with Australia s internal affairs or using political funding to influence them.    At the same time, we want to again urge Australia to remove their biases and take an objective and positive attitude to assess China and its relations with Australia,  he added. However, leading opposition Senator Sam Dastyari quit some senior Labor Party positions last week after a tape surfaced of him appearing to endorse China s contentious expansion in disputed areas of the South China Sea, against his party s platform. The tape, which showed him standing next to property developer Huang Xiangmo, a major Chinese political donor, was leaked to the media.  I take those reports, as do my colleagues, very seriously,  Turnbull said. However, the new laws  are not about any one country , he said.  Foreign interference is a global issue ... for example, we re all familiar with very credible reports that Russia sought to actively undermine the United States  election ... the threat is real,  Turnbull said. The new laws, should they pass parliament, would ban foreign donations to political parties or any political group that has spent more than A$100,000 ($76,350) campaigning in the past four years - a rule that could also likely affect environmental and other campaign groups. Australia expressed deep concern last month over a crackdown on pro-democracy groups in Cambodia. Despite that, Finance Minister Mathias Cormann said foreign donations to activist group GetUp!, a non-partisan but vocal critic of the centre-right government, would be banned under Australia s new laws. GetUp! said in a statement only 0.5 percent of its donations come from overseas. It criticised the proposed laws as an attempt to avoid scrutiny of government policies and for failing to curtail donations from multinational corporations. The definitions of treason and espionage would also be broadened under the new laws to include possessing or receiving sensitive information, rather than just transmitting it. Since the controversial sale of the port of Darwin to a Chinese company in 2015, the government has been at pains to demonstrate limits to its ties to China, its biggest export partner, blocking sales of Australia s biggest cattle station and biggest power grid to Chinese interests.

      " ['Pentagon budget requests $146 million in support for Israel defense'\n",
      "  'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Defense Department’s fiscal year 2017 budget requests $145.8 million in support for Israel, including Iron Dome and other cooperative defense programs, according to Pentagon documents released Tuesday. The Iron Dome system is designed to defeat short-range missiles and rockets. The United States will also continue to help fund David’s Sling, a medium-range missile interceptor, set to be deployed this year, as well as the Arrow ballistic missile interceptor. The systems are meant to form a multi-level shield that the Israelis are developing with Washington’s help as a bulwark against Iran and its allies on the Israeli border. The U.S. Missile Defense Agency’s fiscal 2017 budget request  included $103.8 million for Israeli cooperative programs, down from $267.6 million in fiscal 2016, plus $42 million for Iron Dome, down from $55 million in fiscal 2016. The budget forecast total spending on Israeli cooperative programs of $540 million over the next five years, with no additional funding for Iron Dome envisioned after $42 million in fiscal 2017. Vice Admiral James Syring, director of the U.S. Missile Defense Agency, told reporters the agency was working with Israel under a co-production agreement signed for the Iron Dome system, with a “not insignificant” workshare going to U.S. firms. He declined to give the specific percentage share. Syring said the United States and Israel were working on a second co-production agreement for the David’s Sling program,  although he declined to give a timeframe for reaching a deal.  He said a test of the David’s Sling system late last year exceeded expectations. Raytheon Co is working with Israel’s state-owned Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd on the Iron Dome and David’s Sling programs.  Syring said Israel had not signaled any plans to request additional funds for missile defense programs, as it did last year, after the agency sent its budget request to Congress. He said any decision on funding would be up to Congress, which must approve the budget. Robert Scher, assistant defense secretary for strategy, plans and capabilities, told Congress last year that the U.S. government had provided more than $3 billion to Israel for work on David’s Sling and other missile defense programs since 2001.

      " ['Indian techies, IT firms fret as Trump orders U.S. visa review'\n",
      "  'MUMBAI (Reuters) - For Grishma, an Indian software designer, President Donald Trump’s review of the visa programme for bringing highly skilled workers into the United States comes at a bad time. Fresh from gaining a master’s degree in Europe, and with an offer of employment from a well-known U.S. design firm, she was well on her way to fulfilling the ambition of many young Indian IT workers - a dream job in America. But as she waits in the H-1B visa queue for the green light, she is caught in a bind. “It’s a weird time to be applying, with all the scrutiny,” said Grishma, who gave only her first name for fear of jeopardizing her chances of getting a visa. The United States has already suspended the “expedited processing option” for applicants, under which she may have received a visa in weeks. More broadly, uncertainty over the review announced this week has unsettled Grishma and many others like her. She will have to wait until at least around August to learn her fate, but having accepted the U.S. job offer she is not in a position to apply for positions elsewhere, including in Europe. “It’s pretty debilitating,” Grishma told Reuters. “I’d like to start work to mitigate the financial damage.” Trump’s decision was not a huge surprise, given his election campaign pledge to put American jobs first. But the executive order he signed, though vague in many areas, has prompted thousands of foreign workers already in the United States or applying for visas to work there to re-think their plans. Companies who send them also face huge uncertainty. The concerns are particularly acute in India, where IT firms like Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd are top beneficiaries of the H-1B visa programme, using it to send computer engineers to service clients in the United States, their largest overseas market. Experts say Trump’s order to review visa processes is aimed at firms like TCS, Infosys and Wipro, which from 2005-14 snagged around 86,000 H-1B visas, roughly equivalent to the number of H-1B visas the United States issues in total each year. Two industry sources said Infosys, India’s No. 2 information technology (IT) services company, is applying for just under 1,000 H-1B visas this year, which one of the sources said was down from 6,500 applications in 2016 and some 9,000 in 2015. It was not clear whether the sharp reduction in 2017 was in direct response to Trump’s presidency, although the company has said for some time it wanted to cut dependence on “fly-in” staff. TCS, Infosys and Wipro said they would not share data on the number of H-1B visas they had applied for this year. With fewer visas going to Infosys, more might become available for smaller IT companies and big U.S. tech companies, like Facebook and Microsoft Corp, that typically send in fewer H-1B applications each year. U.S.-based immigration lawyer Murali Bashyam, managing partner of Bashyam Spiro LLP which advises and works with small to mid-sized Indian IT firms, said clients had been in contact seeking clarity, while the number of visa applicants had fallen. “I think the reason for that is they get the sense that it’s going to get so much tougher to comply with all of the changes ... that it might not be worth their money,” he said. “There is a fear that radical immigration changes are coming, and if those radical immigration changes come then it could completely change the way IT staffing companies do business.” Bashyam said the number of people on H-1B visas already working in the United States who were considering returning to their home country had risen. An engineer working at Cisco, who has been in the United States since 2011, said that three months ago he would not have considered returning to India. But the review of the visa system, and any rule change that revoked the right for his wife to work in the United States on a dependent visa, could force him to change his mind. “If that happens, then I would definitely be interested in going back to India. Even though I’m secure, I don’t want to be in a situation where my wife cannot work,” said the engineer, who declined to be named. “Those who have heavily invested here, who’ve bought houses, property and are still on visas, are afraid.” According to Bashyam, some Indians on H-1B visas were cancelling plans to return home to visit their families in case they had problems getting back into the United States. “With everything that’s going on, traveling outside the U.S. is the biggest fear for a lot of the H-1B workers working in the IT staffing industry,” he said. And the uncertainty is not limited to IT. Trump’s campaign rhetoric around tighter visa rules has led some Indian students considering studying abroad to look beyond the United States, which typically draws in over 100,000 Indian students annually. One Canadian official said the number of student visa applications for certain courses in Canada had spiked over 250 percent since Trump’s election win in November. Akshay Baliga, a management consultant with a H-1B visa that is valid until 2018, said he was not considering returning to the United States for work any time soon. “As a professional I’m looking eastward,” said Baliga, now based in India but who earlier studied and lived for years in America.

      " ['House, Senate letters back Asia military funding proposal'\n",
      "  'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. members of Congress has backed a proposal for $7.5 billion of new military funding for U.S. forces and their allies in the Asia-Pacific region, where tensions have risen over China’s territorial ambitions and military buildup. Five members of the U.S. House of Representatives and eight senators from both the Democratic and Republican parties wrote to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to support the Asia-Pacific Stability Initiative (ASPI) proposed in January by John McCain, chair of the Senate Armed Service Committee. Copies of the letters were seen by Reuters. Their signatories include members of the armed services committees in both houses of Congress. McCain’s proposal calls for $1.5 billion annually for five years to 2022 to boost U.S. munitions stocks in the region, build new military infrastructure, such as runways, and help allies and partners increase their capabilities. The House letter urged Mattis to incorporate McCain’s proposal in the fiscal 2018-22 defense budgets. “The Asia-Pacific region holds many interests for U.S. foreign policy that will require our government to continue to prioritize our time, energy and resources there,” it said. The letter called former President Barack Obama’s policy of giving precedence to the Asia-Pacific “sound” and it was “critical” that this be continued under President Donald Trump. It expressed concern about “the eroding military and economic balance that is the result of the People’s Republic of China’s two-decade military modernization, combined with the effect of years of sequestration on the U.S. military and our foreign policy apparatus.” The Senate letter also expressed concern about increasing Russian activity in the region and North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs. “ASPI will show both allies and adversaries that the U.S. remains committed to ensuring peace and security in a region that contains the world’s three largest economies, four most populous countries, six of the world’s largest armies, and five of the seven U.S. mutual defense agreements,” it said. Trump has vowed to take a tougher line with China and to build up the U.S. military, although it is unclear whether he will succeed in lifting caps on defense spending that have been part of “sequestration” legislation. China is due to announce its defense budget for this year this weekend, and its navy is likely to secure significant new funding as Beijing seeks to check U.S. dominance of the high seas and step up its projection of global power.

      " ['Reuters surveys UK financial services jobs post-Brexit'\n",
      "  'LONDON (Reuters) - Around 10,000 finance jobs will be shifted out of Britain or created overseas in the next few years if the UK is denied access to Europe s single market, according to a Reuters survey of firms employing the bulk of workers in international finance. Reuters approached 158 banks, asset managers, private equity firms, insurers and exchanges with UK operations on their plans for moving staff as a result of Brexit and received answers from 123. [L4N1LO3T7] Fifty-seven companies said they would have to move staff or restructure their businesses because of Brexit, which is due to take place in March 2019.  Another 37 said Brexit would have no impact, and the remainder said they are still deciding what to do or declined to comment. The survey was conducted by email and telephone interviews between Aug. 21 and Sept. 15. A total of 55 banks responded, along with 37 insurers and insurance brokers, 28 asset managers and private equity firms, and three exchanges. They included the 20 investment banks that earned the most fees from investment banking in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters  data. Some participants declined to comment on some of the questions. Some participants also asked for the information to be part of an aggregate only, which is why Reuters has not published the complete data. The insurers who responded to the survey included the largest listed insurers in Britain, along with large European Union and non-EU insurers operating in Britain, major insurance brokers and listed and unlisted insurers with an international focus, such as those operating in the Lloyd s of London market. Twenty-eight asset managers managing a collective $25 trillion responded. They included most of the global managers who use the UK as a base in Europe, as well as the leading British firms. Survey participants were asked if Brexit would mean new jobs in the European Union and if so, to give details about whether they would be new jobs or transfers from London. They were also asked how many UK employees they currently have. Seventy-five organizations provided the number of staff they currently employ in the UK, which added together totaled 484,578. Of those 357,617 were employed by banks, 106,348 by insurers, 16,363 by asset managers and 4,250 by exchanges. The 39 firms which gave details on their plans for Brexit staffing together employ at least 359,983 people. A precise number could not be calculated because four did not answer the question. The 20 banks in the survey who answered the question about how many jobs would be affected by Brexit said they expected 9,777 jobs to be moved or created in the EU.  Eleven insurers expected 98 roles to be created in the EU in total. Eight asset managers and private equity firms who gave the information saw 311 jobs in total being created. Of banks who have made a decision on what to do about Brexit, six planned to add jobs in Frankfurt, four in Paris, three in Dublin, two in Amsterdam, one in Berlin and one in Brussels. Among insurers, seven were setting up subsidiaries in Luxembourg, six in Dublin, three in Brussels, and one each in Malta, Munich and Paris. For the asset managers, nine said they were considering moving staff to another country or hiring locally there. The most popular destination was Luxembourg, chosen by seven firms, followed by Dublin with one and one undecided. There are 344 banks registered in Britain, according to the Bank of England, although that includes the domestic-focused subsidiaries of many larger banks as well as many smaller lenders that earn the bulk of their revenue in Britain so won t be affected so much by Brexit. There are 503 UK authorized insurers, according to the Bank of England, though many larger firms have more than one authorization. Many UK insurers also have a purely domestic focus, insurance specialists say. While the asset managers contacted account for the lion s share of the assets managed in Britain, there remains a long tail of smaller managers registered with the Financial Conduct Authority, a figure it currently puts at 1,840 firms.

i do n’t know . xxmaj it ’s sure looking that way now , ” xxmaj nolte said . “ xxmaj anyone here ( at xxmaj davos ) who is in the mainstream says there is no way he could possibly get the nomination . xxmaj when i hear that , it probably means it is going to happen . ” xxmaj noting the challenge to xxmaj clinton from xxmaj sanders , which he said could pull her to the left on issues like financial regulation , xxmaj nolte said institutional investors were already paying attention to the prospect of increased xxup u.s. political xxunk from the election . xxmaj xxunk xxmaj huffington , whose xxmaj huffington xxmaj post news website once insisted on covering xxmaj trump , a former reality xxup tv star , as an entertainment figure rather than a politician , said the site reversed its policy once he announced his proposal to ban xxmaj muslims from entering the xxmaj united xxmaj states , which made him too \" dangerous \" to ignore . \\ xa0 “ i feel the mainstreaming of xxmaj donald xxmaj trump , instead of him being treated as an extreme , dangerous candidate , is really the most troubling aspect of xxmaj american politics right now , ” she said . “ xxmaj he ’s being interviewed on all the main shows , and he ’s being asked questions about what his first xxmaj state of the xxmaj union address would be like if he wins , instead of actually being forced to answer the tough questions about his policy , especially his policy of wanting to ban xxmaj muslims from entering the xxup u.s. , which is so dangerous , so un - xxmaj american and should really be the center of the coverage of xxmaj trump . ” xxmaj for xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk , global managing director for business consultancy mckinsey , xxmaj trump has turned the political campaign itself into “ entertainment ” , which could hurt the global image of the xxmaj united xxmaj states . “ xxmaj it ’s a bit embarrassing globally . xxmaj but i think there ’s a big difference between the rhetoric and the reality , and i think most people will see that and xxunk it . xxmaj but it ’s incredible how long its been going for . xxmaj it ’s just unbelievable , ” he said . xxmaj but not everyone is worried . xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk , executive vice president of xxmaj indian outsourcing firm xxmaj infosys , said his firm has earned the majority of its revenue in the xxmaj united xxmaj states for more than 30 years . \" xxmaj we have seen many elections come and go . xxmaj it is common in all election seasons for rhetoric and extreme personalities to shine . xxmaj inevitably we have found governments from both sides to eventually come up with sensible policies , \" he said . \\ xxunk by xxmaj xxunk xxmaj geller , xxmaj carmel xxmaj xxunk , xxmaj noah xxmaj xxunk and others ; xxmaj writing by xxmaj peter xxmaj xxunk ; editing by xxmaj anna xxmaj xxunk ) ' \n",
