      "[['Long speech, lots of tea: party meeting with Chinese characteristics'\n",
      "  \" BEIJING (Reuters) - The speech was long, the refreshments austere, but Zhang Weiguo, a Communist Party official from Hubei province in central China, was thrilled.   It was strongly persuasive, infectious, cohesive, and had rally-appeal,  Zhang said after Chinese President and party boss Xi Jinping gave a nearly three-and-a-half hour speech in Beijing s cavernous Great Hall of the People to kick off the 19th Communist Party Congress.   I came out of the auditorium feeling infected, my motivation infinitely enhanced.   The scene is a far cry from a convention of the Democratic or Republican Party in the United States, with their rock concert-like atmosphere, balloons falling from the rafters and raucous cheering crowds.  Instead, most delegates wore conservative business suits, turned pages of the speech in unison, and clapped politely on cue, giving the start of China's most important political event in five years the vibe of an academic conference.  This is party politics with Chinese characteristics. Delegates from China s dozens of ethnic minority groups were required, as always, to wear traditional costumes, often with elaborate headgear - and news photographers swarmed.  An Olympian wore the national team s jacket. Military men and women, as well as police, donned crisp uniforms. All, including Xi, wore red identifications badges.  Entering the Great Hall for the event required airport-level security checks, with x-ray machines and metal detectors. Outside food and drink were not allowed. Journalists, many of whom had queued in the rain since before dawn, were permitted one mobile phone each.  Inside, Xi laid out a vision for a strong and confident China stretching decades into the future. The speech will be the subject of intensive study by party members across the country in coming months and serve as a model for its content and language.  Still, it was a marathon even by Chinese politicians  standards, and some in the audience dozed off.  For those needing a refreshment, uniformed servers standing in order by height poured tea and hot water into Great Hall of the People paper cups outside the main auditorium.  One server who had been present for the 18th Party Congress five years ago said nothing had changed.   Everything s the same. Our service is getting better, though,  he said.  On stage, where the party s powerful Central Committee and former leaders sat, hosts and hostesses periodically marched from the wings in unison to pour fresh steaming water into porcelain mugs. At the two-hour mark, some started taking toilet breaks.  Luo Jialin, a member of the Sichuan province delegation, rushed to the post office at the Great Hall of People and bought five books of congress-themed stamps with the Great Hall postmark for 450 yuan ($68).   They are very commemorative, so I want to bring some back home,  said Luo.  The speech was broadcast live and images of groups of people watching it quickly circulated on social media - doctors at a hospital, Tibetan monks, prisoners in a detention center, and even children in kindergarten. One posting showed a cat sitting in front of a TV broadcasting the speech.  Printed copies of Xi s speech for foreign reporters were produced in 12 languages, including Lao and Portuguese, up from eight five years ago. The Chinese version ran to 68 pages.  Pictures of the seldom-seen 91-year-old former President Jiang Zemin peering at his copy through a chunky magnifying glass flew across the internet.  Later, someone identified Jiang s magnifying glass as German-made and posted a picture of an ad for it on Taobao. Price tag: 1,598 yuan, or about $240.  ($1 = 6.6219 Chinese yuan renminbi)  \"\n",

      "  'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bill that many lawmakers hoped would send a message to President Donald Trump to keep a strong line against Russia hit a new snag in the U.S. House of Representatives on Friday, as Republicans proposed combining it with sanctions on North Korea. The Russia sanctions bill passed the Senate on June 15 by 98-2, but it has not come up for a vote in the House. The chamber’s Republican leaders initially said there was a technical problem with how the bill was written, but after the Senate altered the bill to fix it, the measure still did not move. On Friday, Republicans suggested reworking the legislation to add new sanctions on North Korea. The Russia sanctions measure passed by the Senate is part of a broader bill that also includes new sanctions on Iran. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said he wanted the North Korea sanctions added to the bill. “It would be a very strong statement for all of America to get that sanction bill completed and done, and to the president’s desk,” the Republican lawmaker said in the House as it wrapped up its activity for the week.  Democrats rejected the suggestion as another tactic by Republicans supporting White House objections to the bill.  “This isn’t a serious proposal. It’s the latest delay tactic,” said Representative Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. The House passed a new package of sanctions on North Korea in May by 419-1, and Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, a Republican, said on Thursday his committee would be taking it up soon.  On Friday, Corker said he would be “more than glad” to consider adding North Korea to the legislation if the House chose to do so. Engel said there was no point in passing North Korea legislation again. The Trump administration objects to a provision in the Russia bill that sets up a process for Congress to approve any effort by the president to ease sanctions on Moscow. Seeking a greater influence in foreign policy, Congress has included provisions in a few recent major bills, starting with Corker’s 2015 legislation forcing congressional review of President Barack Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran. Lawmakers and aides have been negotiating for weeks to try to craft a compromise that would allow the Russia-Iran bill to move forward. On Thursday, they said they thought it could advance soon but on Friday said the North Korea issue made that less likely. [L1N1K42BV] '\n",

      " [\"South Africa's ANC calls for nationalizing central bank, land expropriation\"\n",
      "  'JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa s ruling African National Congress has adopted a resolution calling for the nationalization of the central bank and land expropriation without compensation, a senior party official said on Wednesday. Any mention of nationalization in South Africa is enough to spook investors, since left-wing elements of the ANC have also called for mines and banks to be state-owned. Similarly, land is an emotive issue two decades after the end of apartheid, and the ANC has been under pressure to redress racial disparities in land ownership. Unlike most central banks in the world, the South African Reserve Bank has been privately owned since it was established in 1921. But its shareholders have no control over monetary policy, financial stability policy or banking regulation. Following a meeting of party delegates, the head of the ANC s economic transformation committee, Enoch Godongwana, told reporters changing the ownership of the South African Reserve Bank would not affect its independence. He said the party had also agreed to initiate amendments to the constitution to achieve land expropriation without compensation, but gave no timeline. He said there would be no illegal occupation of land. Following the proposal made in July by the ANC at a policy conference to nationalize the bank s shareholding, South Africa s Reserve Bank said that changing its shareholding would not affect its mandate, because that mandate is derived from the constitution. Godongwana said no timeline had been laid down for the plan to acquire the central bank s shares or for any directives to parliament to change the country s laws to effect the change.  No change in the constitution, no change in the Reserve Bank Act,  he said.  We ve also said it s not likely to have an impact at all because shareholders in the Reserve Bank do not affect monetary policy in any way.   Godongwana said the changes would come after  more work  was done to prepare for the bank s nationalization. In July, when the party said it would like the central bank to be wholly state-owned, investors were initially worried and knocked the rand.  The currency was little changed on Wednesday immediately after the announcement by Godongwana, but analysts said markets would react negatively.  The SARB resolution will spook the markets even if it is ultimately unlikely to be implemented,  said Anne Fruhauf political analyst with consultancy Teneo. On the land issue, Godongwana said some of the delegates became  rowdy  during the heated debate that  nearly collapsed the conference . ANC officials rejected reports that delegates had come to blows during the debate. Godongwana said the delegates eventually agreed to initiate some amendments to the constitution in order to achieve expropriation of land without compensation.  The condition is that it must be sustainable and not impact on food  production and food security,  he said, adding that there should be no illegal occupation of land. Asked how the markets would react, Godongwana said:  My suspicion is they are going to say  wow  and react badly ... my sense is, if I was the markets, I would simply hold off.  Most of South Africa s land remains in white hands 23 years after the end of white minority rule. Experts say the plan to expropriate land in South Africa will not signal the kind of often violent land grabs that took place in neighboring Zimbabwe, where white-owned farms were seized by the government for redistribution to landless blacks. However, some economists and farming groups have said the reform could hit investment and production. Around 8 million hectares (20 million acres) of land have been transferred to black owners since apartheid ended, equal to 8 to 10 percent of the land in white hands in 1994, the government says. The total is only a third of a 30 percent  target by 2014 set by the ANC. '\n",

      " [\"Italy's Renzi pledges to hike budget deficit if he wins election\"\n",
      "  'ROME (Reuters) - Former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said on Thursday that if he wins next year s election he will slash taxes and sharply raise Italy s budget deficit rather than lower it as European Union rules require.  We ll take the deficit back up to 2.9 percent (of gross domestic product), cutting taxes by 30 to 50 billion euros  ($59.14 billion),  Renzi, the leader of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) said in an evening television interview. Italy has committed to cutting its deficit to 1.6 percent of GDP next year from a targeted 2.1 percent this year, and to balance its budget in 2020. Brussels says reining in the annual deficit toward zero is necessary to bring down Italy s huge public debt of 132 percent of GDP, the highest in the euro zone after Greece s. Ahead of the election to be held by May, all the main parties have come out strongly against the EU s so-called  fiscal compact , agreed in 2012, which sets tough deficit and debt-reduction goals for high-debt countries like Italy. Renzi resigned as prime minister in December last year after losing a referendum over his plans for constitutional reform, and was replaced by his former Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni. He first floated the idea of hiking the deficit in a book he published in July, but the suggestion drew a cool response from Italian government ministers and the EU. The PD is running neck-and-neck with the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, according to opinion polls, but the surveys suggest no party or coalition is likely to win a working majority in parliament.

       "  ' xxunk the days of the xxmaj old xxmaj west shooting an an unarmed man violated a code that xxunk lived by and brought shame as well as arrest and prosecution for murder . xxmaj but in the conservative version of the xxmaj old xxmaj west we are being forced to live in today , codes and the law mean nothing as long as you re a xxmaj christian gun nut . xxmaj during the morning church service on xxmaj sunday at xxmaj keystone xxmaj xxunk xxmaj church located within xxmaj montgomery xxmaj county in xxmaj pennsylvania a xxunk with a concealed carry permit shot and killed xxunk - old xxmaj robert xxmaj xxunk in the chest during some sort of altercation as members of the xxunk xxunk for cover after the shots xxunk out . xxmaj it sounded like three xxunk , almost like a champagne xxunk opening three times , said xxunk xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj everybody s trying to make themselves as small as possible . xxmaj you could hear some screaming and some crying but it was pretty silent . i went under a chair in a xxunk position . i tried to make myself as small as possible . xxmaj it s really frightening that anything like this could happen here . xxmaj despite the fact that the gun - xxunk xxunk openly murdered an unarmed man for what is sure to be a ridiculous reason , the man has not been arrested or charged , according to xxmaj montgomery xxmaj county xxmaj district xxmaj attorney xxmaj kevin xxmaj steele . xxmaj there s no one in custody , he told xxup nbc 10 . xxmaj the individual involved in the shooting is cooperating with police at this point . xxmaj yeah , and he s the only one who gets to tell the story because the other guy is dead . xxmaj ironically , the xxmaj keystone xxmaj church had written a xxmaj facebook post earlier announcing that an anti - government evangelical pastor would be a guest speaker that day and banned xxunk and video for our guest s safety . xxmaj apparently , church leadership was not concerned about guns or the threat they pose to the safety of their xxunk . xxmaj here s the video via xxup nbc xxunk , a man literally shot and killed an unarmed man in the middle of a church service and he gets to walk free . xxmaj this is sickening . xxmaj featured image via xxmaj wikimedia ' \n",

       "  ' xxup washington ( xxmaj reuters ) - a senior xxup u.s. official overseeing a xxunk of the xxmaj state xxmaj department that has been criticized by current and former xxup u.s. diplomats has stepped down after less than four months on the job , xxup u.s. officials said on xxmaj monday . xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk , a former financial industry executive who was named xxmaj state xxmaj department counselor on xxmaj aug. 17 , is “ stepping away ” to return to xxmaj boston , said a department spokesman on condition of anonymity . xxmaj christine xxmaj xxunk , the department ’s deputy chief of staff , will take over the agency ’s “ xxunk , ” he added . xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state xxmaj rex xxmaj tillerson has been criticized by current and former xxup u.s. diplomats as well as by some members of xxmaj congress for his management of the agency , where may top posts have not been filled nearly 10 months into xxmaj tillerson ’s tenure . xxmaj the department has also seen an exodus of senior diplomats . xxmaj tillerson defended the department when he was recently asked about morale problems and concerns that the agency was being weakened . “ xxmaj the xxunk is going to address all of that . xxmaj and this department is performing extraordinarily well , and i take exception to anyone who xxunk otherwise . xxmaj it ’s just not true , ” he said on xxmaj nov. 20 . xxmaj state xxmaj department officials observing the xxunk say it has been plagued with uncertainty both about what xxmaj tillerson wants to achieve and how to go about it . “ xxmaj if the one thing she ( xxmaj xxunk ) was asked to do was the xxunk and she is quitting ... how does this not reflect poorly on the overall management of this enterprise , that is the xxunk ? ” said one official who spoke on condition of anonymity . xxmaj another xxmaj state xxmaj department official said xxmaj xxunk had left of her own xxunk and was not fired . xxmaj xxunk did not immediately respond to voicemails left at her office and xxmaj massachusetts phone numbers or to an email sent to her xxmaj state xxmaj department address . xxmaj the xxmaj state xxmaj department spokesman declined comment on criticism of the xxunk . a congressional aide said the effort is so xxunk that xxmaj congress is unable to pass legislation to give the agency the legal authority to make changes . “ xxmaj to do that we would need to have some road map - something - and none of that has been provided , ” said the aide , who spoke on condition of anonymity .

       "  ' xxmaj americans woke up on to a country that will soon have xxmaj donald xxmaj trump serving as president . xxmaj it is a frightening realization . xxmaj however , overcome with horror , the irony of the date went largely xxunk by many . xxmaj november 9 , the day after xxmaj election xxmaj day , is the anniversary of the xxmaj berlin xxmaj wall coming down . xxmaj on this day in 1989 , the spokesman for xxmaj east xxmaj berlin s xxmaj communist xxmaj party announced that citizens of the xxup xxunk would be permitted to freely cross the country s borders . xxmaj the scene of xxmaj east and xxmaj west xxmaj xxunk flooding to the site became xxunk . xxmaj people used hammers and picks to chip away at the wall . xxmaj the reunification of xxmaj east and xxmaj west xxmaj germany was made official on xxmaj october 3 , 1990 , almost one year after the fall of the xxmaj berlin xxmaj wall . xxmaj while almost three decades ago this date became synonymous with freedom in the hearts and minds of so many , xxmaj americans woke up today to a president - elect that plans to build a wall of his own . xxmaj since the very beginning of his election , xxmaj trump has promised to build a wall along the border between xxmaj mexico and the xxmaj united xxmaj states . xxmaj of course , he still insists that xxmaj mexico is going to pay for it . xxmaj anti - immigrant rhetoric served as the foundation of xxmaj trump s campaign and the wall was his keystone . xxmaj anti - immigrant rhetoric has served as the foundation of xxmaj trump s campaign and the wall has been his keystone . xxmaj while most of us were simply xxunk by the reality of a xxmaj trump presidency , some couldn t help but notice the date and point out the irony . xxmaj the sad irony is that the # xxunk came down today in 1989 and # xxunk is about to build a new one that will be just as brutal . xxmaj harry xxmaj leslie xxmaj smith ( xxunk ) xxmaj november 9 , xxunk is said that those who don t learn from history are doomed to repeat it . xxmaj it certainly looks as if we have an awful lot to learn . xxmaj this is more proof of just how far backward we have to go for xxmaj trump to xxmaj make xxmaj america xxmaj great xxmaj again . xxmaj we took one step forward 27 years ago , and today , we took 10 steps back . xxmaj featured image via xxmaj xxunk ' \n",
